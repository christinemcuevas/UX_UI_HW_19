                    <h1> Hey, I'm Christine </h1>
                    <p>I am a detail-oriented Product Manager at Petco looking to pursue my passion for UX/UI design. From a young age, I was drawn toward web design, albeit mostly on Myspace! It didn't occur to me to pursue a digital design career until later in life when I was put on an application redesign project as a Business Systems Analyst. While design is typically out-of-scope for this role, it was at a small firm where I had the opportunity to wear many hats, including designer! This role exposed me to my very first experiences with wireframing, site-mapping, and even deploying HTML/CSS code through SVN.

                        <br> <br>While I do thoroughly enjoy user interface design, I feel my true passion and skillset lies within the user experience realm of UX/UI. The challenges of balancing a unique design with usable and familiar flows is a problem that I love to solve.
                        
                        <br> <br> My experience as a Product Manager enables my holistic approach to problem solving that keeps both the stakeholder's and the user's best interest in mind. Having a multifaceted skillset in the world of software development allows me to best collaborate with business leaders, developers, QA, and designers alike.
                        
                        <br> <br>I am currently completing a UX/UI certification program at University of California, Irvine with the goal of becoming a Product Designer. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Systems from California State University, Fullerton where I completed relevant coursework in C# and C++.</p>

                        <p>I've been wireframing since the start of my career as a Business Systems Analyst. Granted, I've updated my toolkit from simple Microsoft Paint to more fun tools like Figma and InVision since then.</p>

                        <p>Building functional prototypes is one of the areas within product design that I am most passionate about. I enjoy the process of determining various potential user flows, and solving for them in Figma.</p>
